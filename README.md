# Butterfly Images classification project with PyTorch


This project utilizes Pytorch for the classification of butterfly images using deep neural networks. the model is trained on a labeled dataset containg 75 species of butterflies.

I am proud to share that i have meticulously crafted the neural network architecture form scratch for this project. Every layer, connection, and activation function has been thoughtfully designed and implemented to tailor it specifically to the task at hand.
